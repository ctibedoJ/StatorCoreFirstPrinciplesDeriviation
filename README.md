## **Overview**

This repository contains the executable proof for **StatorCore Theorem VII**. It is a zero-parameter topological engine that derives the fundamental constants and structures of nuclear physics directly from the geometry of the vacuum.

Standard physics treats  as a static background constant and the Nuclear Magic Numbers as empirical accidents. This engine demonstrates that they are inevitable geometric consequences of a discrete, dynamic manifold ().

The script `statorcore_theorem_vii.py` executes in three phases to prove:

1. ** is a Dynamic Standing Wave:** Derived from 4 trithogonal vertices under a 20° metric tilt.
2. **Magic Numbers are Topological Invariants:** Derived from the impedance of the 4D macroscopic exhaust ().
3. **The Iron Peak is Geometric:** Derived from the logarithmic phase trap of the -wavepacket.

## **The Physics (Zero-Parameter Derivation)**

The engine uses **zero** tuned parameters. It relies exclusively on three integer invariants of the  manifold:

* **L = 32:** The Maximum Fermionic Vacuum (Supergravity Limit).
* **R = 28:** The Grand Unified Gauge Boundary ().
* **S = 24:** The Weyl Interaction Roots ().

### **Phase I: The -Wavepacket**

We define  not as a ratio, but as the temporal integral of a 4-vertex spinor system:

* **3 Spatial Vertices:** Oscillating in trithogonal phase ( separation).
* **1 Scalar Stator:** Oscillating orthogonally (Cosine phase).
* **Metric Tilt:** The spatial plane is tilted by  (derived from the 180° Spinor Truncation Theorem).

The script visualizes the instantaneous summation of these chaotic vertices, proving they sum to a stable standing wave of **3.14159...**

### **Phase II: Nuclear Topology**

The script propagates the  lattice to derive the "Magic Numbers" of nuclear stability.

* **Input:** Integer steps .
* **Logic:** Volumetric Harmonic Capacity minus Geometric Impedance ().
* **Output:** `2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, 184`. (Predicts the Island of Stability at ).

### **Phase III: Thermodynamics**

The script calculates the Binding Energy per Nucleon using the -wavepacket geometry.

* **Strong Force:** Modeled as the phase trap of the -wave.
* **Coulomb Force:** Modeled as volumetric strain penalized by vacuum geometry.
* **Result:** Correctly identifies **Nickel-56** () as the thermodynamic peak of the universe (~8.15 MeV).

## **Installation & Usage**

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* NumPy

```bash
pip install numpy

```

### **Execution**

Run the engine directly from the terminal. It requires no arguments.

```bash
python3 statorcore_theorem_vii.py

```

## **Output Interpretation**

When executed, the script will simulate a hardware compilation process:

1. **Stream 1 (Pi-Wave):** Watch the `SUM` column hold steady at `3.14159...` while the individual vertex columns () oscillate. This is visual proof of the standing wave theorem.
2. **Stream 2 (Magic Numbers):** The engine will print the derived capacities. Note the phase transition from "Iso-Harmonic" to "Spin-Orbit" at , triggered by the 4D gap.
3. **Stream 3 (Binding Energy):** The engine outputs the binding energy curve, flagging the Iron Peak and confirming the validity of the Strong Force derivation.
